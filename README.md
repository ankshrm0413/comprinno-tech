Fibonacci series:


1. Iterating till the range and taking the no of elements as input. Return an object that produces a sequence of integers from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive) by step. range(i, j) produces i, i+1, i+2, ..., j-1. start defaults to 0, and stop is omitted. When step is given, it specifies the increment (or decrement).
2. Read a string from standard input. The trailing newline is stripped.Take the input from the user and store in the variable s=input().
3. Creating a new dictionary d={}.
4. Executing  from the statement from the input which is stored in variable s.
5. After the statement is being executed if it's satisfy then it will increment the value of input and store on the empty disk.
6. Empty list to store the proceding values of the fibonacci series.
7. Add and update the values from the list and store it accordingly.
8. Checks up the value <3 if yes then it is DYNAMIC or else it directly goes to the else part.
9. Checks the conditions c1,c2,c3 is valid to implement the fibonacci series is its true and satisfy then its dynamic or else- else part is executed.
10. Again the program is ready for being executing.
